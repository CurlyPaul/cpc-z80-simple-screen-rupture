### If the screen is split like this, how much room does it take up?

My current short/wide screen should be..

a bit smaller, but not in a way that's obviously useful to exploit due to the way the lines are interspersed across the address range. Might be usful to return to this and draw a graph to see if there is space to use

For the time being, drawing separate blocks of memory 

### What is it that causes the screen to restart somewhere else?

If I just want to draw the same graphic again, what would i have to do to trigger it? Currently, changing the screen address and the VTOT

### Can we split wherever the hell we like?

Yes, but the timing has to be correct
